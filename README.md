# SHOPPING-BEHAVIOUR-ANALYSIS

Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behaviour using Microsoft Excel as the primary analytical tool. The aim is to transform raw transaction data into meaningful insights that can guide business decisions, enhance customer understanding, and improve sales performance.

In a competitive retail environment, understanding how customers interact with products  including what they buy, when they buy, and how they pay  is crucial. This study applies data analytics techniques within Excel to explore patterns such as top selling items, preferred payment methods, and seasonal trends in purchasing.

Story of the Data

It contains customer transaction records covering different product categories, purchase amounts, demographics, and payment preferences. Each record represents a single purchase and includes variables such as:

Customer ID
Age Group and Gender
Product Category and Item Purchased
Purchase Amount
Payment Method
Season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter)
Customer Rating (1–5)
Shipping Type
The data tells the story of diverse shopping patterns influenced by customer demographics, product type, and seasonality. It represents real world retail behaviour, making it suitable for trend analysis and business insight generation.

Data Splitting and Preprocessing

Before analysis, the dataset underwent several cleaning and preparation steps to ensure accuracy and reliability.

a. Splitting and Organization
Data was organized into separate sheets and tables for clarity:

Raw Data Sheet: Contained the original dataset.
Cleaned Data Sheet: Contained refined data after preprocessing.
Pivot Data Sheet: Used for aggregations and dashboard visuals.


b. Preprocessing Steps
Key preprocessing activities included:

Duplicate Removal: Eliminated repeated transactions using Remove Duplicates.
Missing Values: Handled blank fields using IF and logical replacement.
Data Type Correction: Ensured numeric columns (like Purchase Amount) were properly formatted.
Standardization: Unified inconsistent labels (e.g., “Credit card” vs. “Credit Card”).
Categorical Sorting: Classified data into age groups and seasonal categories for easy filtering.
c. Tools and Functions Used:
Excel’s Data Validation for controlled entries

 Conclusion
 
The Shopping Behaviour Analysis provided valuable insights into customer purchasing trends and preferences using only Excel.
The project demonstrated that Excel can handle data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization effectively without external BI software.

Through careful preprocessing, structured analysis, and visualization, the data revealed actionable insights on customer segments, product demand, and payment habits. Businesses can use these insights to improve marketing strategies, optimize inventory, and enhance customer satisfaction.
